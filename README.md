# Songbox

I want to build a kind of musicbox type thing. Basically, a box with a speaker and a single button that starts play an endless loop of a a song if it's not already, and stops it from playing if it is.

This is a super simple POC of building a single binary that bundles an audio file and plays it when the program starts.
